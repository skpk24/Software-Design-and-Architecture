# Clean Code

## Code smells : Code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.

That doesn't means a bug, code smells are usually not a bugs, they are not technically incorrect or don't ruin the programefrom functioning. Instead they indicate weaknesses in design that may slowdown the development or increase the risk of bugs or failures in the future. 

Bad code smells can be an indicator of factors that contribute to technical debt.

# SOLID Design principles :

> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> Open Close Principle (OCP)

> Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Interface Segregration Principle (ISP)

> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


## SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

One class should have one and only one responsibility.

Example : [here](./solid-principles/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple)

## OCP (Open Close Principle)

Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  
Example : [here](./solid-principles/OpenClosePrinciple)
  
## LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base/super types.

Example : [here](./solid-principles/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple)

##  ISP (Interface Segregration Principle)

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. OR Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use.

Example : [here](./solid-principles/InterfaceSegregrationPrinciple)

## DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions OR High level module should not depend on low leve modules, both should depend on common abstraction layer.

Example : [here](./solid-principles/DependencyInversionPrinciple)

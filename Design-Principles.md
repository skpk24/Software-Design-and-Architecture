# SOLID Design principles :

> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> Open Close Principle (OCP)

> Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Interface Segregration Principle (ISP)

> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


## SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

One class should have one and only one responsibility.

Example : [here](./solid-principles/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple)

## OCP (Open Close Principle)

Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
